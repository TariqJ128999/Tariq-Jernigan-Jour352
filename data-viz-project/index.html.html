    <h1>What Actually Makes a Good NFL Offensive Coordinator? And Are There Fewer of Them in 2023?</h1>

    <h2>Three OCs have already been fired this season, and offense is down across the board. But being good at this job requires a lot more than just play-calling and what fans see on the field on Sundays.</h2>
    <h3>By Tariq Jernigan</h3>
    <p>In the world of offensive coordinators, you either get hired as a head coach, or you stay an OC long enough to see yourself become the villain. Just look at Ken Dorsey. Dorsey was hired by Buffalo in 2019 to become the Bills quarterbacks coach. He was charged with overseeing Josh Allen’s development, and within a year, he helped Allen become an MVP candidate. That work earned Dorsey a promotion to offensive coordinator in 2022, and that season, the Bills offense improved in every major statistical category despite a tough schedule and a midseason injury to Allen’s throwing arm. Not a bad four years of work for an NFL assistant.</p>

        
<p>But this year, Dorsey’s second at the helm, the offense experienced some inconsistency; avoidable turnovers turned winnable games into losses, and Dorsey was unceremoniously fired last week following the team’s late-game meltdown against Denver. And Bills fans weren’t upset about it! Despite the offense’s success under his watch, Dorsey’s play-calling had become a point of frustration in Buffalo, with complaints ranging from “They’re throwing it deep too often” to “They’re throwing it too short.” And while there was never much substance to those criticisms, the offensive coordinator is always a good scapegoat when the head coach’s seat heats up—or when the first-round quarterback isn’t playing well. Matt Canada learned that lesson this week when the Steelers fired him following another Kenny Pickett stinker.</p>
